## Abstract
With the development of electronic warfare, anti-jamming measure becomes more and more complex. There have been certain research results on jamming strategies, but only a few research materials on anti-jamming strategies. It is difficult to simulate the real jamming environment, and there is no appropriate anti-jamming decision-making model for research. Cognitive radar can perceive the environment and receive feedback, which provides the possibility to solve the problem of anti-jamming decision-making. This article regards the anti-jamming measure as a kind of interaction behaviour and establishes the cognitive radar antagonistic environment model and uses the reinforcement learning algorithm to solve the problem of anti-jamming decision-making. Finally, this article verifies the feasibility of applying reinforcement learning theory on making anti-jamming decision in the radar antagonistic environment model. The performance of different reinforcement learning algorithms is compared, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.
